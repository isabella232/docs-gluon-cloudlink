This topic describes how to use Gluon CloudLink Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='intro'></a> Introduction

When a PCF operator installs the Gluon CloudLink Service Broker for PCF tile, they specify a Gluon account. A Gluon account can have multiple subscriptions, and each subscription is associated with a Gluon CloudLink app.

The Gluon CloudLink Service Broker for PCF creates a service plan in the Marketplace for each Gluon subscription/app. You can create a service instance based on one of these plans and bind the service to your PCF app.

##<a id='using'></a> Bind the Service to Your App

Follow the steps below to bind the Gluon CloudLink service to your app using either Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

###<a id='cli'></a> Create and Bind with the cf CLI

Follow these steps to create and bind a service instance with the cf CLI.

1. Run `cf marketplace` to list the plans available for the `gluon-cloudLink-service-broker` service. Each plan
   represents an active subscription for a Gluon CloudLink app.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf marketplace -s gluon-cloudlink-service-broker
	Getting service plan information for service gluon-cloudlink-service-broker as admin...
	OK

	service plan                  description                                                          free or paid
	Gluon CloudLink Application   Gluon CloudLink Application - 45XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX   free
	</pre>

1. Create a service instance for the plan of your choice by running `cf create-service` and entering the service name, service plan name, and a service instance name. For example:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-service gluon-cloudlink-service-broker "Gluon CloudLink Application" "Gluon CloudLink App"
	</pre>

1. Bind the service instance to your PCF app by running `cf bind-service` and entering the name of the app followed by the service instance name. For example:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf bind-service hello-world "Gluon CloudLink App"
	</pre>

1. Run `cf env` to display the credentials for the bound Gluon CloudLink app:

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf env hello-world

	Getting env variables for app hello-world in org Gluon / space My Space as admin...
	OK

	System-Provided:
	{
	 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
	  "gluon-cloudlink-service-broker": [
	   {
	    "credentials": {
	     "clientKey": "45XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
	     "clientSecret": "3eXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
	     "hostname": "https://cloud.gluonhq.com",
	     "serverKey": "MHwwDQ..."
	    },
	    "label": "gluon-cloudlink-service-broker",
	    "name": "Gluon CloudLink App",
	    "plan": "Gluon CloudLink Application",
	...
	</pre>
